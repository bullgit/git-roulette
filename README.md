# git-roulette

Make your git workflow less boring. What's life without a little risk?

## Usage

```
$ git add .
$ git roulette "A super descriptive commit message"
$ git push # If you're lucky
```

`git roulette` is just like `git commit -m`, but with a twist : once in a while, it'll blow up in your face and do something silly.

But don't worry! You'll always get a warning message and git-roulette won't ever do something that can't be fixed easily (if you know your way around git), or that will affect any or your collaborators.

## TODO:
- Obligatory "How git-roulette uses git-roulette to develop git-roulette" conference talk
- `git-roulette --hint` to give advice on how to fix things
- `git-poker`?
- fix intermittent bug that crashes the whole system and removes the whole repo on all remotes once in a while
